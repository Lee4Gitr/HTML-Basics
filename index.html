<!--index.html is the most important name you'll need to know as a web developer. Most browsers will automatically use
index.html as the file to render.-->

<!--Anything within the less than exclamation mark dash dash and dash dash greater than symbols is a comment. These do
not get rendered to the screen.-->

<!--This information at the top tells the browser that this is supposed to be a webpage and it should render it as
HTML. It also says to render it using the language code of "en", short for english. -->

<!--The "head" element is used to for displaying metadata, or data about the page to the browser. It can describe how
the page should look if it's linked to on Facebook, Twitter, or what displays in the tab of the browser (Here,
"lesson 1"). It is also used
to link CSS and Javascript, but more on that later.-->

<!-- Welcome! This is HTML! This is also the first lesson of how to become a web developer. I'm going to have to explain
 a few things first, and you're just going to have to accept them as gospel for the time being. While it may not always
 be entirely accurate, it will ground you firmly enough to progress. First, double click this file in your folder. It
 should open in your preferred browser. I'm using Chrome. If you notice anything off, try it in Chrome first. Sometimes
 browsers can be fussy.-->

<!-- HTML stands for (H)yper(t)ext (M)arkup (L)anguage. Hypertext is just a way of saying text you
receive over the internet. It's an old term, but it stuck. Markup just means it is structurally significant for a
website and you can style it and add functionality. Language means it's well documented and is expected to act a
particular way. If we use a house as a metaphor for web development, HTML is the wood, nails, glue, and concrete that
hold the house together.-->

<!-- Anything you see between the "<" and ">" can be called a tag or element. Within the tag, you will see a name.
That name will describe how that tag is or isn't displayed on the browser. Some tags also have closing tags, which is
just the name repeated, but it ends with a slash. For instance "<div>" is the opening tag, and "</div>" is the closing
tag, where the name of this tag is "div". There can also be attributes on a tag, for instance, below there is a
"section" tag. It's ending tag is towards the end  of the file. It has an attribute called "class" with a value of
"section". For now, we aren't going to worry about it, I'm just going to tell you that I'm adding it to make the site
easier to read.-->

<!--Don't worry about anything between the nav tags, we'll go over it later.-->

            You can put anything you want into "div"s, and it will render in your browser!
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <div>
                <div> You can also nest as many "div"s inside of each other as you want!</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <p class="block">There are many other types of tags as well. Here is an "ol" tag, or Ordered List.</p>
            <ol class="block">
                <li>"ol"s must have "li", or list items.</li>
                <li>They will display items numerically, incrementing after each "li" element.</li>
                <li>This should be the third item.</li>
            </ol>
            <!-- No amount of space between here will affect the space between the elements when they're rendered in
             the browser-->
            <p class="block">This is a similar tag, called a unordered list or "ul", except the items aren't numbered.
                They're usually just dots, but sometimes they aren't anything, just a new line!</p>
            <ul class="block">
                <li>Just a new line</li>
                <li>new line number 2...</li>
                <li>and dot number 3!</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="block">
                Here is a "p" tag, or paragraph tag. While it will render very similarly, it's important to understand
                their differences. One very important rule is: You cannot nest a div inside of a "p" tag.
            </p>
            <p class="block">
                A nice element to use to break between import paragraphs is a horizontal rule, or "hr" element. It adds
                some nice spacing between other elements.
            </p>
        </div>

        <hr/>

        <div class="block">
            <h2>Block vs. Inline</h2>
            <p class="block">Now the important part... These have all been block level elements. This means they take
                up room on a web page. There are different types of elements that <strong>DON'T</strong> take up space,
                and that was just one of them. These are called "inline" elements. They include the <b>b or Bold</b>
                tag, the <i>i or italic</i> tag, the <span> span </span> tag, and the two most important inline tags,
                the image tag <img src="./imgs/illegally-smol.jpg" alt="Illegally smol. Take him away boys.">,
                which must have a "src" or source attribute specifying where the image is, and an "alt" text attribute,
                which will display if the image isn't loaded or if someone is using a screen reader. Alt attributes
                aren't strictly necessary, but they are a "best practice" when talking about modern websites. They make
                it easier for people of all abilities to use your site. As you can see, the image tag doesn't create a
                new area, it just renders along with the other text! <b><i>R-i-d-i-c-u-l-o-u-s</i></b>.
            </p>
            <p class="block">
                The final inline element you need to know is the "a" or anchor tag. This can be used to link to link to
                other <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a" target="_blank">sites</a>,
                or used to navigate to another page on your website! As a matter of fact, lets do that!

                <a href="Assignment.html"><b><i>Click me!</i></b></a>
